# Components

Components implement views. Each component renders a specific section of the HTML.

## Root Component

The `App` component is the site's root.

## Routing, IndexRoutes etc

Routing binds a root component to each URI.

IndexRoute sets a default route for a directory URI (i.e. `/hello/` --> `HelloWorld`).

## Other Components

Create your own components and mount them in the pages.

See https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html for details.
